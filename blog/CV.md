- Env：AWS|Spark|Python|Scala
- Desc：It is based on data collected from various channels of HBO to analyze and manage, and transform, store and publish data according to the planning of marketing department. The project uses AWS based service as the core to build the application of serverless. The project uses the open source framework Spark to process large data and uses Scala language to develop. In the project, AirFlow is used to schedule each module to complete the data analysis related processes based on different dimensions, which are based on time, data target system, data source system and so on. We develop a continuous integration method based on GitHub and Jenkins integration, Maven compilation and ansible publishing.
The main functions of this project are to develop project managers and participate in main function development.
1. collect the user information in each subsystem.
2. filtering, filtering and verifying user information in different systems.
3. use scheduling to process, transform and store different data.
4. provide the result data to provide Restfull calling method based on AWS API GateWay.

##### 2016-09 -- 2018-05 CIC Risk Management project
- Env：Perl|Hadoop|Java|Shell|Python
- Desc：The CIC Risk Management system provides all kinds of data support, and a scheduling system based on Perl language is used. It is mainly used to integrate each module in the ETL process to improve data conversion and storage and provide other system calls, and to design related general modules.
1. based on the existing wind control system, the data module boundary is redefined.
2. reintegrate the process to achieve high concurrent flow; improve the program to achieve high availability;
3. improving log module and interface program can eliminate problems and exceptions.
4. redesign and improve the overall performance by increasing the total amount.
- Repo/Role:
1. lead the team to grow. Under the dual driving force of self driving and business driven, the team led closely follows the company's rhythm and grows rapidly.
2. provide technical support and core module development.

##### 2015-05 -- 2016-05 Supply chain finance
- Env： Java|Spring|Mybatis
- Desc： Supply chain finance is a financial platform for bulk trading, designed for the characteristics of bulk trading. All the business processes and rules are combed, and the design of the interest rate module is completed through the rules engine and other tools. It can satisfy all kinds of interest rate scenes, such as the way of bank counting, and the way of the Jingdong interest rate. Fat cat white is a financial platform for small customers, through the docking of Jingdong gold color system to complete the business online, including data validation, encryption, decryption, interaction, and exception handling.

##### 2013-10 -- 2014-04  IBM Sterling B2B
- Env： Java|Spring|Mybatis
- Desc：SteringB2B is a multi - Enterprise Service Architecture Based on Sterling Commerce or a platform for the development and integration of effective business cooperation to eliminate obstacles. The main function of my current module is to focus on the function of transmission files, a platform based on the current demand for transfer of file and file format in electronic commerce, which is mainly applied to cross company transmission that requires a large number of documents at home and abroad. This transmission requires your hardware facilities to support more intensive transmission times, more massive file capacity, and endless file formats and protocols. A high-end enterprise file transfer solution can help you establish a unified, safe and easy to manage B2B file gateway system. Compared with the traditional transmission mode, it can reduce the operating cost and increase the productivity of the organization, and optimize the unit time profit rate, improve the customer satisfaction, reduce the operation risk, and strengthen the institutional security level, thus strengthening the transparency of the internal users and effectively control the transmission of B2B files. The whole system uses the SOA architecture based on ESB, each module is independent of different business and logic functions. The system uses the message bus of IBM's EMB to transmit messages, that is, all modules or systems communicate with each other through the message of the transmission of ESB. Queue uses the queue of IBM, the project has a lot of word systems, which are used to display UI parts to spring, Ibatis and other open source architectures, and the other parts are mainly implemented by multithreading of Java, as well as the open source framework and components of Apache, such as commons components. DB2 is used in the database section.
- Repo/Role:
1. develop file type module, file access, file conversion, file storage, file tracking, file output;
2. docking with other systems and modules.
